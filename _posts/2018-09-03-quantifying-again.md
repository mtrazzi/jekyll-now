title: Quantifying Again
---

This morning, I ran 4.88 km. As always, I tracked my run using RunKeeper. 

**Problem**: I stop when I start feeling tired if there is no incentive to keep running

**Solution**: Beeminder ([once again](https://medium.com/@MichaelTrazzi/maintain-healthy-habits-with-beeminder-37743d0ca181)).

This time, I'll be tracking [running](https://www.beeminder.com/mtrazzi/run) and my [public writing](https://www.beeminder.com/mtrazzi/publicwords).

I have tried a couple of writing hacks (e.g. writing 750words every day or writing one blog post every day on LessWrong/Medium).

This time is different. I'm measuring _public words_ on a single webpage: [mtrazzi.github.io](https://mtrazzi.github.io/), using Beeminder.

The goal is to have something intermediary between private journaling and Medium/LessWrong blogposts.
