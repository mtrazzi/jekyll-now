Ok. This is a test. I am trying to see if writing stuff on a personal blog could work.

I already have a few websites where I write : [Lesswrong](https://www.lesswrong.com/users/mtrazzi), [Medium](https://medium.com/@MichaelTrazzi) and [750words](http://750words.com/).

The goal here would be to do something low effort. To just push unpolished ideas into the wild.

Of course, I could always do that privately, on 750words. But on 750words I tend to write stuff that is too much self-oriented, and I don't feel I am making much progress on stuff that I actually care about.

I want to write *online*, to do what I call _crystal writing_, i.e. crystalizing your thoughts so that anyone can judge them.

I want to write more. On June 15th, about two months ago, I [claimed that I would come back to daily blogging](https://medium.com/@MichaelTrazzi/getting-back-into-writing-c2c7e983a30b).

But I didn't.

Medium doesn't _feel_ right for daily blogging.

Time is running out. I had this dream to write a book.

How do you even start writing a book? One word after the other. You publish stuff online, one after the other.

The main objective is to produce _ideas_.

What would be my goal with this blog?

Well, one cool thing could be to force myself to write more, and have an objective way to tell if I am achieving that (e.g. how many words I have pushed on the website the last _n_ days).
