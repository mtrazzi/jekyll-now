title: My Relationship with Time
---

I'm 22.81052 years old.

What have I been doing all this time?

I have been constantly trying to optimize my time.

The important thing is to _feel_ the flow of time, to measure it.

A few months ago, I thought I found **the** answer to this conundrum: just enter some data about your life every 15 minutes (what I called "[coloring my life](https://hackernoon.com/focus-hacking-with-complexity-and-colors-f3073c725232)".

Now, I try to observe time in our physical world. I constantly turn my personal hourglass. You see the time _flowing_ to the the bottom.

The summer starts. You have 3 months ahead of you (June, July and August). And then it ends. At what point do you _experience_ time?

- Summer begins in June. Everything seems possible. "Ok, this summer I will write a bunch of interesting stuff for ten hours a day!".

- In July, the page is not blank anymore. You still have time to do stuff, but you started going in one direction.

- August. Now everything seems over. You only have a few days left. You start to think about everything you _haven't_ done this summer.

I feel like I'm constantly running out of time. I try to escape from the flow of life, but time never stops.

The hourglass is running out of sand.

One last ray of sunshine.

Summer is over.
